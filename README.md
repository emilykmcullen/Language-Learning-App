Language practice app

MVP:
-The app should allow the user to practise sentences and words in their target language
-The user should be able to add sentences in English, choose their target language from a drop-down list, write their target language sentence and choose the difficulty level from a drop-down list
-The user should be able to edit and delete sentences
-Once created the user should be able to see only the English version of their sentence/ word
-When they click on the sentence/ word they should be able to input their target language translation
-They should receive feedback on whether they were correct or incorrect
-The user should be able to ‘show’ the answer if they are unable to get it correct

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS:
-The user could be able to sort the sentences by ‘tags’
-The user could be able to move sentences/words from an ‘in practice’ section to a ‘mastered’ 
  section once they are confident with the sentence and don’t want to practice it anymore ( I’m 
  not sure quite how to do this, perhaps by having a property in the sentence class ‘mastered’ 
  that is a boolean and is set to false on creation, once the user practises the sentence on the
  ‘Results’ page they could have an option to check a box that says ‘I have mastered this’. If 
  they check this box it would run a function to update the boolean to True and the sentence could
  then be place in the ‘mastered section’
-The user could be able to generate a random one of their sentences to practise rather than selecting it themselves
