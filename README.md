<h2>Overview<h2>

<h5> When learning a language I always use a notebook to store new phrases and vocabularly, however I 
never return to this notebook to actually practise them! With Lingua Snaps I aimed to solve this issue
by making an app that allows the user to actively practise their phrases they have stored.<h5>
